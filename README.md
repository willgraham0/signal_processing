# Signal Processing

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to better understand Fourier and Wavelet
transformations, which are commonly used in applications such as
compression and noise removal.

The code has not been written with speed in mind - there are many good
libraries out there that do this stuff fast for real applications - but
I hope for the purposes of illustrating the theory, that it does the job.

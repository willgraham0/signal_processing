# Signal Processing

## Introduction

The purpose of this project was to improve my understanding
of what is really going on in signal processing when we talk
about Fourier and Wavelet transformations in applications such
as compression and noise removal.

The code I have written is by no means fast - there are
extremely good libraries out there that do this stuff well
for real applications - but I hope for the purposes of learning
the theory, that it does the job.
